# ðŸŽ£ D&A Projects ðŸŽ£
#### Like casting and reeling a fishing rod, extracting and wrangling only the data required ~~to make a tasty meal~~ for analysis!


## Summary

Hello! This is my folder containing 4 D&A projects, provided and reviewed by Udacity, all with their own folders:

- Analyze A/B Testing
  - Implementing hypothesis, A/B testing and Logistic Regression models to make a calculated estimate whether a new page converts more users to pay for a product

- Investigate a Dataset
  - Choosing a specific dataset to provide insights into movie/genre profitability through multiple visualizations

- US Bikeshare Data
  - Extracting multiple files while building custom functions with extensive for loops capabilities to make assessments on biking customer data
  
- Wrangle and Analyze Data
  - Gathering data via direct download from urls and web scraping to make tidy and quality cleaning for proper insights and vizs


They showcase my meticulousness and coding skills to review, clean and assess multiple data sources while understanding the complexities of data types and structures, functions and powerful libraries such as numpy, pandas and seaborn


Thank you for checking my Github :)
