# ðŸ¤– ML Projects ðŸ¤–

## Summary

Hello! This is my folder containing 3 Udacity ML projects, all with their own folders:
- Creating Customer Segments
  - Analyzing customer spending habits through unsupervised learning to identify specific customer segments via clustering algorithms

- Finding Donors for Charity
  - Comparing and contrasting different supervised learning models to predict whether donors donate based on specific features

- Predicting Boston Prices
  - Analyzing intricacies of Decision Tree Regression models and overfitting/underfitting risks


They showcase my ability and curiosity in explaining prediction through multiple algorithm models in order to have a fun and thorough understanding of data science.

Thank you for checking my Github :)
