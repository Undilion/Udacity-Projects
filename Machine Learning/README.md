#### What is knowledge? That's a philosophical question but let's teach it to machines \*robot noises\*

## Summary

Hello! This is my folder containing 3 ML projects, provided and reviewed by Udacity, all with their own folders:
- Creating Customer Segments
  - Analyzing customer spending habits through unsupervised learning to identify specific customer segments via clustering algorithms

- Finding Donors for Charity
  - Comparing and contrasting different supervised learning models to predict whether donors donate based on a target variable

- Predicting Boston Prices
  - Analyzing intricacies of Decision Tree Regression models and overfitting/underfitting risks


They showcase my ability and curiosity in explaining prediction through multiple algorithm models in order to have a fun and thorough understanding of data science. All work was submitted through jupyter notebook ( e.g [filename].ipynb ) so please use that as reference while other files are secondary.


Thank you for checking my Github :)
